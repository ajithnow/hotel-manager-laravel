# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our project to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of others' opinions and experiences.
- Using inclusive language and avoiding derogatory or offensive comments.
- Being open to constructive feedback and ideas from others.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards others.
- Respecting privacy and personal boundaries.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or any form of offensive or inappropriate behavior.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments or personal attacks.
- Intimidating or bullying others.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that violates the rights of others or creates a hostile or uncomfortable environment.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated by our community. Anyone who engages in such behavior may be temporarily or permanently banned from participating in our project and community activities.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness any instances of unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially. The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
